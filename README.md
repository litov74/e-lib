# e-lib project



## What is actually it?

It is a simple in-excel-made software **without** 
any tables to make librarians' lives easier and less nervous.

__THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED FOR FREE AND "AS IS"__


### 1. Authorisation

By default its got 3 accounts with different priveleges. Here's a list of 'em:

login: Admin passw: admin80 rights: rw + addusr
(However, addusr wasn't made due to its useless)



login: Библиотекарь passw: lib rights: rw

login: Гость passw: empty rights: r

__All Logins and Passwords 're stored in users Sheet. Don't forget to edit 'em!__

### 2. Books List

It is the first screen that meets you every time after login. Add/edit/modify/delete your books here! 

#### Books edit

Screen is used to edit books. Because it's my first VBA project I didn't managed to make ListBox fields
editable. The value sends to "edit" form to be {obviously} edited.


### Some other views...








P.S. This software was made in few days by myself and it also was my first time using VBA. That's why it's got some issues, which will be resolved soon.
